We export text files from the Shimadzu TOC/TN instrument and process the file using MATLAB. The MATLAB code takes in the following:
* Name of the text file exported from the instrument
* Weighed amounts of KHP and KNO3 for the concentrated stock solution
* Weighed amount of the dilution made daily to run as a standard curve
